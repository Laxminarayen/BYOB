contract by contract basis and represents the unbilled direct and indirect costs incurred as at the year end. These,General Text
typically arise where mid month valuations have occurred and a time apportioned estimate of the cost of measured,General Text

expenses in the period in which they are incurred and contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs,General Text
incurred where it is probable that they will be recoverable.,General Text
The “percentage of completion method” is used to determine the appropriate amount to recognise in a given,General Text
period. The stage of completion is measured by the proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date,General Text
compared to the estimated total contract costs. Costs incurred in the year in connection with future activity on a,General Text

Current tax,Income Tax Payable
The tax currently payable is based on taxable pro<U+FB01>t for the year. Taxable profit differs from net pro<U+FB01>t as reported in,General Text
the pro<U+FB01>t and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other,General Text
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company’s liability for current tax is,General Text
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.,General Text
Deferred tax,Deferred Income Tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to,General Text
the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future,General Text

1.10 Employee benefits,Employee Benefits Payable
"The costs of short-term employee bene<U+FB01>ts are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are",General Text
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or <U+FB01>xed assets.,General Text
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are,General Text

1.12 Leases,Other Expenses
"Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to income on a",General Text
straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more,General Text

and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other,General Text
sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are,General Text
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.,General Text
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates,General Text
"are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the",General Text
period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.,General Text

STRATEGIC REPORT,General Text
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2018,Date
The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 January 2018.,Date
Fair review of the business,General Text
The company is a well established groundworks and frame contractor trading for over 24 years. The company's head,General Text
office in Northolt enables it to service its customer base in London as well as the South of England. The company also,General Text
operates a construction service in Holland.,General Text
During the year the company has experienced significant expansion with turnover increasing by just over 14%. Please,General Text
refer to key performance indicators for more details. The sustained growth was achieved despite challenging market,General Text
conditions and increased competition. Improved efficiencies in project delivery and commercial management have both,General Text
contributed to the achievements of the company coupled with the outstanding performance of its loyal and committed,General Text
workforce.,General Text
The company continues to successfully tender for key contracts and continues to receive repeat orders from satis<U+FB01>ed,General Text
customers and thereby continues to maintain its established customer base.,General Text
Principal risks and uncertainties,General Text
Commercial Risk,General Text
"The company manages this risk by providing added value services to its clients, having fast response times not only in",General Text
supplying products and services but also in handling all client queries and by maintaining strong relationships with clients.,General Text
The company’s commercial risk is reduced due to the market share of their clients as many of the company's clients are,General Text
long standing market leaders in their field. The company has spread its commercial risk by not only actively seeking to,General Text
widen its client base but also through continued expansion of its activities in the South of England and Europe.,General Text
Taxation risk,General Text
The company is exposed to financial risks from increases in tax rates and changes to the basis of taxation including,General Text
corporation tax and VAT. Principal controls to mitigate this risk include regular monitoring of legislative proposals and the,General Text
engagement of experienced executives and the use of experienced sector-speoific professional advisers to mitigate the,General Text
impact of changes.,General Text
Management risk,General Text
"The company is reliant on its small high calibre team of Operational managers, surveyors and board of directors. The",General Text
"company recruits and develops high calibre employees, many of whom have been with the company for a number of",General Text
years. The board have tried to ensure that the knowledge base of the operational management team is shared as much,General Text
as possible throughout the company.,General Text
Financing risk,General Text
See Financial instruments.,General Text
Economic risk,General Text
The directors have identified and evaluated risks and uncertainties and have controls in place to mitigate these.,General Text
Responsibility for management of each key risk is identified and delegated. The company is exposed to the risks of the,General Text
"economic downturn that could lower the company’s revenues and operating results in the future. However, actions",General Text
continue to be taken to maximise the company's performance in all aspects of the business.,General Text
Development and performance,General Text
The balance sheet on page 10 of the financial statements shows that the company's financial position at the year end is.,General Text
"in both net assets and liquidity terms, an improvement over the previous year.",General Text

For The Year Ended 31 January 2018,Date
1. Accounting Policies,General Text
1.1. Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements,General Text
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain properties and,General Text
"financial instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below.",General Text
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets. The following,General Text
accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the,General Text
company’s financial statements.,General Text

For The Year Ended 31 January 2018,Date
1.2. Turnover,General Text
Turnover comprises amounts invoiced for goods and services exclusive of value added tax.,General Text
Revenue Recognition,General Text
The company’s revenues are derived from licence fees and charges for services. The company recognises licence revenue,General Text
in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 605-10 “Revenue Recognition” and FASB ASC,General Text
985-605 “Software Revenue Recognition” except where these criteria conflict with the requirements of FRS 102. For,General Text
"licence arrangements that do not require significant production, modification or customisation of the software, the",General Text
company recognises licence revenue when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists; (2),General Text
delivery to the customer has occurred; (3) the fee to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection,General Text
is probable.,General Text
"If the licence fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable, revenue is recognised as payment becomes due,",General Text
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The company assesses whether fees are fixed or,General Text
determinable at the time of sale and recognises revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. The,General Text
"standard payment terms are net 30; however, terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed.",General Text
Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on the company's,General Text
"successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. If",General Text
"collection of the fees from the customer is not considered probable, revenue is recognised when the fee is collected.",General Text
"Revenue arrangements with resellers are recognised, net of fees, when persuasive evidence is received that the reseller",General Text
has sold the products to an end user customer and all other revenue criteria are met.,General Text
The company generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to,General Text
each element based on the relative fair values of the elements. Revenue recognised from multipIe-element arrangements,General Text
is allocated to various elements of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements specific to the,General Text
company. The company's determination of fair value of each element in multi-element arrangements is based on,General Text
vendor—specific objective evidence (“VSOE”).,General Text
The company limits its assessment of VSOE for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold,General Text
"separately or the price established by management, having the relevant authority to do so, for an element not yet sold",General Text
separately.,General Text
If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered,General Text
"elements, then revenue is recognised using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the",General Text
undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognised as revenue.,General Text
"Revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognised rateably over the maintenance term, typically one year.",General Text
"Revenue allocated to implementation, training and other service elements is recognised as the services are performed.",General Text
The company obtains VSOE for maintenance from substantive renewal rates based on consistent percentages of the,General Text
licence fee.,General Text
Service revenues are derived mainly from implementation and training services. Services are provided primarily on a time,General Text
and materials basis for which revenue is recognised in the period that the services are provided.,General Text
Arrangements that include services are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of,General Text
"other elements of the arrangement. When services are not considered essential, the revenues allocable t0 the software",General Text
services are recognised as the services are performed.,General Text
"The company also offers hosting arrangements, known as Software as a Service (SaaS). With hosting arrangements, the",General Text
company installs and runs software applications through its own or third-party’s servers giving customers access to the,General Text
application via the internet or a dedicated line. Hosting arrangements are within the scope of FASB ASC 985-605 if the,General Text
customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without,General Text
significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either run the software on its own hardware or contract with,General Text
another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software without significant penalty. Assuming all other revenue,General Text
"recognition criteria have been met, and VSOE has been established for the hosting element, revenue is recognised on the",General Text
"portion of the fee attributable to the licence on delivery, while the portion of the fee related to the hosting element would",General Text
be recognised rateably as the service is provided.,General Text
"In SaaS term-based arrangements, where the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of",General Text
"software, SaaS fees are recognised on a monthly basis over the term of the contract commencing when the customer has",General Text
"access to the software. For SaaS arrangements, the Company evaluates whether each of the elements in these",General Text
"arrangements represents a separate unit of accounting, using all applicable facts and circumstances, including whether (i)",General Text
the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis (ii) If a general right of return exists relative to the,General Text
"delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control",General Text
of the vendor.,General Text

measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was,General Text
determined. The resulting exchange differences are dealt with in the Income Statement.,General Text
1.7. Taxation,General Text
Current tax represents the amount expected to be paid or recovered in respect of taxable profits for the year and is,General Text
calculated using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the Statement of Financial,General Text

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet,General Text
date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more tax in the,General Text
"future, or a right to pay less tax in the future. Timing differences are temporary differences between the company's",General Text

HOLM OAK ESTATES LIMITED (REGISTERED NUMBER: 05020153),
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018,
1. STATUTORY INFORMATION,
"Holm Oak Estates Limited is a private company, limited by shares , registered in England and Wales.",
The company's registered number and registered of<U+FB01>ce address can be found on the General,
Information page.,
The presentation currency of the financial statements is the Pound Sterling (£).,
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES,
Basis of preparing the financial statements,
"These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 ""The",
"Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland"" and the Companies Act 2006. The",
financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of,
certain assets.,
Significant judgements and estimates,
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also,
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the company accounting,
"policies. The areas involving a higher degree ofjudgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions",
and estimates are signi<U+FB01>cant to the financial statements are disclosed within the individual accounting,
policies below.,
Turnover,
"Turnover is the total amount receivable by the company for goods supplied and services provided,",
excluding VAT and trade discounts.,
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and benefits of ownership of,
the product have been transferred to the buyer.,
Revenue from services provided is recognised when the company has performed its obligations and in,
exchange obtained the right to consideration.,
"In respect of incomplete contracts, and t0 the extent that a right to consideration arises, the amount of",
revenue recognised reflects the accrual of the right to this consideration by reference to the value of,
work performed to date. Revenue not billed to clients is included in debtors and payments received on,
account in excess of the relevant amount of revenue are included in creditors.,
Tangible fixed assets,
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.,
Freehold property — 2% on cost,
Plant and machinery - 25% on cost,
Motor vehicles - 33% on cost and 25% on cost,
Office equipment - 20% on cost,
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.,
"Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted",
"for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.",
"Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date. The",
selection of these residual values and estimated lives requires the exercise ofjudgement. The,
directors are required to assess whether there is an indication of impairment to the carrying value of,
"assets. In making that assessment, judgements are made in estimating value in use. The directors",
consider that the individual carrying values of assets are supportable by their value in use.,

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued,
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018,
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued,
Investment property,
Investment property is shown at most recent valuation. Any aggregate surplus or deficit arising from,
changes in fair value is recognised in profit or loss.,
Stocks,
"Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for",
obsolete and slow moving items.,
Work in progress,
"Work in progress is valued on the basis of direct cost. Provision is made for any foreseeable losses,",
where appropriate. N0 element of profit is included in the valuation of work in progress.,
Financial instruments,
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short term,
deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less.,
Debtors and creditors with no stated interest rate and receivable or payable within one year are,
recorded at transaction price. Any losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of,
comprehensive income under administrative expenses.,
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual,
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in,
the assets of the entity after deducting all of its <U+FB01>nancial liabilities.,
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a,
"similar debt instrument, those financial instruments are classed as financial liabilities. Financial",
liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet. Finance costs and gains or losses relating to,
financial liabilities are included in the profit and loss account. Finance costs are calculated so as to,
produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding liability.,
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a,
financial liability then this is classed as an equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to,
equity instruments are debited direct to equity.,
Taxation,
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated,
"Statement of Comprehensive Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other",
comprehensive income or directly in equity.,
Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted.,
Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been,
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.,
Deferred tax,
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at,
the balance sheet date.,
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods,
different from those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured,
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are,
expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference.,
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable,
that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.,

GROUP STRATEGIC REPORT,
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018,
The directors present their strategic report of the company and the group for the year ended 31 March 2018.,
REVIEW OF BUSINESS,
The results for the year and financial position of the group are as shown in the annexed financial statements.,
The group continued to experience growth during the last financial year and produced a very satisfactory,
"financial performance. Total turnover on continuing operations increased by £786,427 to £13,981,113",
"resulting in net profit before tax of £944,156 and representing a net margin of 6.75% on sales. Sales have",
increased by 6% while margins have been maintained.,
"During the year, new vehicles and plant to the value of £548k were acquired, a strategy which resulted in an",
increased depreciation charge against profits. The group was able to finance these assets from its own,
resources and at the same time maintain working capital at satisfactory levels.,
"During the year, the group also purchased one new property along with the deposit for another property that",
completed after the year end.,
The year was one of consolidation during which there was further investment in plant and equipment and,
property.,
The group relies heavily on tarmac suppliers both in terms of quality of product and punctual delivery.,
During the year the group attained quality standard ISO 9001:2015 and is currently applying for 14001,
Environment accreditation. These quality standards will rank alongside the group's other industry specific,
accreditations all of which can be viewed on the website.,
The group‘s credit control and cash flow management strategies continue to be rigorously applied and in the,
year under review this resulted in there being no bad debts and increased cash balances.,
Current trading results are ahead of those budgeted.,
Cash flow generated from Operations remains strong.,
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES,
"The group operates in a very competitive environment, focused on timely and efficient service, quality and",
price.,
Pricing of raw materials is critical and as is the maintenance of a good relationship with primary suppliers.,
Pricing of raw materials is critical and is significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and,
the maintenance of a good relationship with primary suppliers.,
"The uncertainties arising from Brexit negotiations are also a risk to the business, as it it dependant upon the",
ready supply of a skilled workforce and any possible changes to trading and tariffs resulting from the outcome,
of these negotiations.,

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES,
"The directors are responsible for preparing the Group Strategic Report, the Report of the Directors and the",
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.,
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law,
the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally,
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company,
law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and,
fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group and of the profit or loss of the group for that,
"period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:",
— select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;,
- make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;,
_ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the,
company will continue in business.,
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain,
the company's and the group's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the <U+FB01>nancial,
position of the company and the group and enable them to ensure that the <U+FB01>nancial statements comply with,
the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and the,
group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.,
STATEMENT AS TO DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS,
"So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418 of the",
"Companies Act 2006) of which the group's auditors are unaware, and each director has taken all the steps",
that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and,
to establish that the group's auditors are aware of that information.,

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018,
AUDITORS,

Annual General Meeting.,
SIGNED BY ORDER OF THE DIRECTORS:,
A S Lauder - Director,

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF,
HOLM OAK ESTATES LIMITED,
Opinion,
We have audited the financial statements of Holm Oak Estates Limited (the 'parent company') and its,
subsidiaries (the 'group') for the year ended 31 March 2018 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of,
"Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Company Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of",
"Changes in Equity, Company Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and Notes",
"to the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, Notes to the Financial Statements, including a summary of",
significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is,
"applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The",
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland' (United Kingdom Generally,
Accepted Accounting Practice).,
In our opinion the <U+FB01>nancial statements:,
give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and of the parent company affairs as at 31 March 2018,
' and of the group's profit for the year then ended;,
_ have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;,
and,
- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.,
Basis for opinion,
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and,
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors',
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the,
group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in,
"the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in",
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and,
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.,
Conclusions relating to going concern,
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to,
report to you where:,
the directors‘ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is,
' not appropriate; or,
the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may,
- cast significant doubt about the group's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting,
for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.,
Other information,
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information in the,
"Group Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors, but does not include the financial statements and our",
Report of the Auditors thereon.,
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form,
of assurance conclusion thereon.,
"In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and,",
"in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or",
"our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we",
"have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required",
to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.,
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006,
"In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:",
the information given in the Group Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors for the financial year for,
' which the <U+FB01>nancial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and,
the Group Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors have been prepared in accordance with,
_ applicable legal requirements.,
Page 6,
REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF,
HOLM OAK ESTATES LIMITED,
Matters on which we are required to report by exception,
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment,
"obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Group Strategic",
Report or the Report of the Directors.,
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to,
"report to you if, in our opinion:",
"adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit",
' have not been received from branches not visited by us; or,
- the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or,
— certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or,
#NAME?,
Responsibilities of directors,
"As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities set out on page four, the directors are",
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair,
"view, and for such internal control as the directors determine necessary to enable the preparation of financial",
"statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.",
"In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group‘s and the parent",
"company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern",
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the,
"parent company or to cease Operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.",
Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements,
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free,
"from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a Report of the Auditors that includes",
"our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit",
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.,
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,",
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these,
financial statements.,
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial,
Reporting Council's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our,
Report of the Auditors.,
Use of our report,
"This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of",
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's,
members those matters we are required to state to them in a Report of the Auditors and for no other purpose.,
"To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the",
"company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we",
have formed.,

ADINALL ENTERPRISES LIMITED,
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017,
1 Accounting policies,
Company information,
Adinall Enterprises Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The,
"registered office is Thomas Eggar House, Friary Lane. Chichester, West Sussex, P019 1UF.",
1.1 Accounting convention,
"These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 ""The Financial Reporting Standard",
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”} and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as,
applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS,
102 have been applied other than where additional disclosure is required to show a true and fair view.,
The financial statements are prepared in sterling. Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to,
the nearest E. The functional currency of the company is Euros. All transactions are converted to sterling at the,
transaction rate. All year end balances are converted to sterling at the year end rate.,
"The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the",
revaluation of freehold properties and to include investment properties and certain <U+FB01>nancial instruments at fair,
value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.,
1.2 Tangible fixed assets,
"Tangible <U+FB01>xed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of",
depreciation and any impairment losses.,
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their,
useful lives on the following bases:,
Plant and equipment 15% reducing balance,
The gain or loss arising 0n the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and,
"the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to pro<U+FB01>t or loss.",
1.3 Impairment of fixed assets,
"At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine",
"whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the",
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where,
"it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amOunt of an individual asset, the company estimates the recoverable",
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.,
"Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the",
estimated future cash <U+FB02>ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re<U+FB02>ects current,
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future,
cash flows have not been adjusted.,
"If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit} is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the",
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit} is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is,
recognised immediately in profit or loss. unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount. in which case,
the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.,
- 3 -,
ADINALL ENTERPRISES LIMITED,
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED),
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017,
1 Accounting policies (Continued),
"Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to",
"apply. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit)",
"is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not",
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the,
asset (or caSh-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or,
"loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is",
treated as a revaluation increase.,
1.4 Cash at bank and in hand,
"Cash at bank and in hand are basic <U+FB01>nancial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks,",
other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. and bank overdrafts. Bank,
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.,
1.5 Financialinstruments,
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 ‘Basic Financial Instruments! and Section 12 ‘Other,
Financial Instruments Issues' of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.,
Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the,
contractual provisions of the instrument.,
"Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is",
a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to,
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.,
Basic financier! assets,
"Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction",
price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method,
"unless the arrangement constitutes a <U+FB01>nancing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value",
of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one,
year are not amortised.,
Ciassi<U+FB01>cation of financial Habih'tfes,
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classi<U+FB01>ed according to the substance of the contractual,
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of,
the company after deducting all of its liabilities.,
Basic financia! ”abilities,
"Basic financial liabilities. including creditors. bank loans, loans from fellow group companies and preference shares",
"that are classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a",
"financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments",
discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.,
"Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.",

DIRECTORS' REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017,
Sayers Butterworth LLP,
AXIALENT EUROPE LIMITED,
Notes to the financial statements,
For the Year Ended 31 December 2017,
2. Accounting policies (continued),
2.3 Revenue,
Turnover is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic bene<U+FB01>ts will flow to the Company and the,
"turnover can be reliably measured. Turnover is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable,",
"excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before",
turnover is recognised:,
Rendering of services,
Turnover from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are provided in accordance,
with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following conditions are satisfied:,
' the amou nt of turnover can be measured reliably;,
' ii is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the contract;,
' the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and,
' the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.,
2.4 Interest income,
Interest income is recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.,
2.5 Finance costs,
Finance costs are charged to the Statement of comprehensive income over the term of the debt using the effective,
interest method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are initially,
recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.,

AXIALENT EUROPE LIMITED,
Notes to the financial statements,
For the Year Ended 31 December 2017,
2. Accounting policies (continued),
2.6 Taxation,
"Tax is recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income, except that a charge attributable to an item of income and",
expense recognised as other comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other,
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.,
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively,
enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company operates and generates income.,
Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the,
"Balance sheet date, except that:",
' The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against,
the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and,
' Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax allowances have,
been met.,
Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of business,
combinations. when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of assets acquired and the,
future tax ded uctions available for them and the differences between the fair values of liabilities acquired and the amount,
that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively,
enacted by the balance sheet date.,
2.7 Tangible fixed assets,
Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any,
accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to,
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.,
"At each reporting date the company assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, the",
recoverable amount of the asset is determined which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.,
An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.,
"Depreciation is Charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives,",
using the straight-line method.,
Depreciation is provided on the following basis:,
Equipment - 33.33% straight line,
Software - 50% straight line,
"The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively if",
"appropriate, or if there is an indication of a signi<U+FB01>cant change since the last reporting date.",
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised,
in the Statement of comprehensive income.,

For the Year Ended 31 December 2017,
2. Accounting policies (continued),
2.8 Debtors,
"Short term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are measured initially at fair",
"value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less",
any impairment.,
2.9 Cash and cash equivalents,
Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on notice of not,
more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no more than three months from the,
date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.,
2.10 Creditors,
"Short term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans, are measured",
"initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective",
interest method.,
2.11 Financial instruments,
The Company only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of financial assets and,
"liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other third parties, loans to related parties and",
investments in non-puttable ordinary shares.,
Financial assets that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for,
"objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the",
Statement of comprehensive income.,
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance sheet when there is an enforceable,
right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle,
the liability simultaneously.,
2.12 Dividends,
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.,
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.,

at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and non-monetary items measured,
at fair value are measured using the exchange rate when fair value was determined.,
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at period-end,
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of,
comprehensive income except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.,

Tangible assets,
"tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and are subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated",
depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded at the fair value,
at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment,
"losses. An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other",
"comprehensive income and accumulated in capital and reserves, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation",
decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying amount of an asset,
as a result of revaluation is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any previously recognised,
revaluation increase accumulated in capital and reserves in respect of that asset. Where a revaluation decrease,
"exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains accumulated in capital and reserves in respect of that asset, the",
excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.,
Depreciation,
"Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value, over the useful",
economic life of that asset as follows:,
Fittings <U+FB01>xtures and equipment - 25 0/0 reducing balance,
"If there is an indication that there has been a significant change in depreciation rate, useful life or residual value of",
"tangible assets, the depreciation is revised prospectively to reflect the new estimates.",
Impairment,
"A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable amount being",
"estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is",
impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. When it is,
"not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable",
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The cash—generating unit is the smallest identifiable,
group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows,
from other assets or groups of assets.,

1. General information,
"The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The address of the",
"registered office is St Georges House, 6th Floor, 15 Hanover Square, London, W18 1H8, United Kingdom.",
2. Statement of compliance,
"These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 1A of FRS 102, ’The Financial",
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland'.,
3. Accounting policies,
Basis of preparation,
"The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modi<U+FB01>ed by the revaluation of certain",
financial assets and liabilities and investment prOperties measured at fair value through profit or loss. The financial,
"statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.",
Revenue recognition,
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services,
"rendered, net of discounts and Value Added Tax. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the",
signi<U+FB01>cant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer (usually on despatch of the goods); the,
amount of revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that the associated economic benefits will flow to the,
entity; and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transactions can be measured reliably.,
Foreign currencies,
"Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in the functional currency, by applying the spot exchange rate",
as at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at,
"the exchange rate ruling at the reporting date, with any gains or losses being taken to the profit and loss account.",
Stocks,
Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost includes,
"all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the stock to its present location and",
condition.,
Government grants,
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable. Grants are not recognised,
until there is reasonable assurance that the company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the,
grants will be received. Government grants are recognised using the accrual model and the performance model.,
"Under the accrual model, government grants relating to revenue are recognised on a systematic basis over the",
periods in which the company recognises the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. Grants,
that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate,
financial support to the entity with no future related costs are recognised in income in the period in which it,
becomes receivable. Grants relating to assets are recognised in income on a systematic basis over the expected,
"useful life of the asset. Where part of a grant relating to an asset is deferred, it is recognised as deferred income",
"and not deducted from the carrying amount of the asset. Under the performance model, where the grant does not",
"impose specified future performance-related conditions on the recipient, it is recognised in income when the grant",
proceeds are received or receivable. Where the grant does impose speci<U+FB01>ed future performance-related conditions,
"on the recipient, it is recognised in income only when the performance-related conditions have been met. Where",
"grants received are prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria, they are recognised as a liability.",
Financial instruments,
A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised only when the company becomes a party to the contractual,
"provisions of the instrument. Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at the transaction price, unless the",
"arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where it is recognised at the present value of the future payments",
discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument. Debt instruments are subsequently measured,
at amortised cost. Where investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary shares or,
"preference shares are publicly traded or their fair value can otherwise be measured reliably, the investment is",
subsequently measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. All other such,
"investments are subsequently measured at cost less impairment. Other financial instruments, including derivatives,",
are initially recognised at fair value. unless payment for an asset is deferred beyond normal business terms or,
"financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate, in which case the asset is measured at the present value of",
the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument. Other <U+FB01>nancial instruments,
"are subsequently measured at fair value, with any changes recognised in profit or loss, with the exception of",
hedging instruments in a designated hedging relationship.,
Financial assets that are measured at cost or amortised cost are reviewed for objective evidence of impairment at,
"the end of each reporting date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in",
"profit or loss immediately. For all equity instruments regardless of significance, and other financial assets that are",
"individually significant, these are assessed individually for impairment. Other financial assets are either assessed",
individually or grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics. Any reversals of impairment are recognised,
"in profit or loss immediately, to the extent that the reversal does not result in a carrying amount of the financial",
asset that exceeds what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not previously been recognised.,

MANGROVE GLOBAL LIMITED,
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2018,
1. General information,
"Mangrove Global Limited is a private company, limited by shares, incorporated in England and Wales, United Kingdom, with a",
"registration number 08674207. The address of the registered office is 53 Redbridge Lane, Ilford, Essex, |G4 5EY.",
The nature of the company's operations and principal activities are the importation and distribution of various spirit brands from,
around the world.,
2. Accounting policies,
2.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements,
The <U+FB01>nancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified within these,
"accounting policies and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard",
applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 2006.,
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting,
estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgment in applying the Company's accounting policies (see note 3).,
The <U+FB01>nancial statements are presented in sterling which is the functional currency of the company and rounded to the,
nearest pound sterling.,
The following principal accounting policies have been applied:,
2.2 Revenue,
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the,
"revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable,",
"excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before",
revenue is recognised:,
Sale of goods,
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied:,
- the Company has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer;,
#NAME?,
nor effective control over the goods sold;,
' the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;,
' it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the transaction; and,
' the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.,
2.3 Intangible assets,
"Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition. under the cost model, intangible assets are measured",
at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.,
"All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life cannot be made, the",
useful life shall not exceed ten years.,
Page 14,
MANGROVE GLOBAL LIMITED,
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2018,
2. Accounting policies (continued),
2.4 Tangible fixed assets,
Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any,
accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to,
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.,
"Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives, on",
the following basis...,
Motor vehicles - 25% reducing balance,
Fixtures and fittings - 20% straight line,
Computer equipment - 33% straight line,
"The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prOSpectively if",
"appropriate, or it there is an indication of a signi<U+FB01>cant change since the last reporting date.",
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised,
in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.,
2.5 Valuation of investments,
"Investments in unlisted Company shares, whose market value can be reliably determined, are remeasured to market",
value at each balance sheet date. Gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the Statement of,
"Comprehensive Income for the period. Where market value cannot be reliably determined, such investments are stated at",
historic cost less impairment.,
2.6 Stocks,
"Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less costs to complete",
"and sell. Cost is based on the cost of purchase on a first in, first out basis. Work in progress and finished goods",
include labour and attributable overheads.,
"At each balance sheet date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stock is impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to",
its selling price less costs to complete and sell. The impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.,
2.7 Debtors,
"Short term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are measured initially at fair",
"value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less",
any impairment.,

2. Accounting policies (continued),
2.8 Cash and cash equivalents,
Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on notice of not,
more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no more than three months from the,
date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.,
"In the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on",
demand and form an integral part of the Company's cash management.,
2.9 Financialinstruments,
"Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year}, including loans and other accounts",
"receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash flows and subsequently at amortised",
"cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, typically trade",
"debtors and creditors, are measured, initially and subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other",
"consideration expected to be paid or received. However, if the arrangements of a short-term instrument constitute a",
"financing transaction, like the payment of a trade debt deferred beyond normal business terms or <U+FB01>nanced at a rate of",
"interest that is not a market rate or in the case of an out-right short—term loan not at market rate, the financial asset or",
"liability is measured, initially, at the present value of the future cash flow discounted at a market rate of interest for a",
similar debt instrument and subsequently at amortised cost.,
Investments in non-convertible preference shares and in non-puttable ordinary and preference shares are measured:,
' at fair value with changes recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income if the shares are publicly traded,
or their fair value can otherwise be measured reliably;,
#NAME?,
2.10 Creditors,
"Short term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans, are measured",
"initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective",
interest method.,
2.11 Finance costs,
Finance costs are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the term of the debt using the effective,
interest method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are initially,
recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.,
2.12 Dividends,
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.,
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting. Dividends on,
shares recognised as liabilities are recognised as expenses and classified within interest payable.,

2. Accounting policies (continued),
2.13 Pensions,
Defined contribution pension plan,
The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under,
which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been paid the Company,
has no further payment obligations.,
The contributions are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when they fall due. Amounts,
not paid are shown in accruals as a liability in the Balance Sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately from the,
Company in independently administered funds.,
2.14 Interest income,
Interest income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income using the effective interest method.,
2.15 Provisions for liabilities,
Provisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the Company a legal or constructive obligation that,
"probably requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the",
obligation.,
Provisions are charged as an expense to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year that the Company,
"becomes aware of the obligation, and are measured at the best estimate at the Balance Sheet date of the expenditure",
"required to settle the obligation, taking into account relevant risks and uncertainties.",
"When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the Balance Sheet.",

MANGROVE GLOBAL LIMITED,
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2018,
2. Accounting policies (continued),
2.16 Current and deferred taxation,
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive,
"Income, except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other comprehensive income",
or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,
respectively.,
The current income tax Charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively,
enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company operates and generates income.,
Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the,
"Balance Sheet date, except that:",
#NAME?,
the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and,
' Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax allowances have,
been met.,
Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of business,
"combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of assets acquired and the",
future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair values of liabilities acquired and the amount,
that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively,
enacted by the balance sheet date.,
3. Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty,
"In applying the Company‘s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in",
"determining the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. The directors' judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on",
"the best and most reliable evidence available at the time when the decisions are made, and are based on historical experience",
"and other factors that are considered to be applicable. Due to the inherent subjectivity involved in making such judgements,",
"estimates and assumptions, the actual results and outcomes may differ.",
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are,
"recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision",
"and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods.",
The directors do not believe that there have been judgements (apart from those involving estimates) made in the process of,
applying the above accounting policies that have had a significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements.,
"There are no key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty, that have a significant",
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.,

MANGROVE GLOBAL LIMITED,
STRATEGIC REPORT,
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2018,
Introduction,
The Principal activity of the company was the importation and distribution of various spirit brands from around the world. Operating in,
the premium sector and across all channels Mangrove aims to have an appropriate product in every category. In addition to this core,
business Mangrove also has some limited operations abroad in Europe and the USA.,
I believe we have made another year of strong progress at Mangrove. Having focused on the key priorities of building brand equity for,
"our partners, recruiting a team to deliver unparalled knowledge and service levels and by ensuring we have an enviable portfolio, we",
are leading the way in the UK. Our balance sheet reflects the progress we have made and continue to make and these foundations,
"Should continue to deliver in future years. Feedback from our customers, supplier partners and shareholders continues to shape our",
business ensuring we are delivering a highly relevant commercial product offering within the premium sector whilst ensuring the,
business continues to operate from a strong commercial base. We have stabilised our business with a view to currency exposure and,
now we are rebuilding profitability. But there is much more we want to do. Our intention is to become even more competitive for,
"customers, a more rewarding employer for our employees and an even better partner for suppliers, while creating long-term value for",
our shareholders. At the centre of everything is our purpose: to help premium brands achieve their potential in the UK marketplace.,
Business review,
We aim to present a balanced and in depth review of the development and performance if our business during the year and is written in,
"the contexts of the risks and uncertainties. The company performed well during the year, with profit for the year being £311,349 (201?:",
"£105,974) with net assets of £910,323 (2017: £1,034,634). Margins were improved despite some rigorous price competition. There are",
some opportunities that I believe we well placed to benefit from as the move towards premiumisation and a wish for our customers to,
rationalise their supplier base makes us a natural partner. Brands are seeking us out in ever increasing numbers and we will continue,
"to evolve the portfolio as these opportunities arise. Changing consumer habits, continued currency volatility and financial weakness",
amongst a segment of our customer base offer Challenges but we have adopted a number of strategies to mitigate these as proven this,
"year. Brexit offers a degree of uncertainty that will affect the industry as a whole but the Directors are very confident in their ability, the",
flexibility of the business and the desirability of the portfolio to be able to take advantage of any opportunities that arise.,
We firmly believe that we have a number of reasons to be optimistic about the coming years as tight cost control and a portfolio in,
growth will deliver ever stronger results.,
Page 1,
MANGROVE GLOBAL LIMITED,
Principal risks and uncertainties,
Competition: There is a great deal of competition from other agents as well at product level. Consolidation within the industry has,
seen opportunity arise for a number of small players but a lack of options for the larger mature brands. Mangrove is well reapected and,
well placed to be able to take advantage of these opportunities should they occur. The competitive landscape will remain challenging.,
Regulation: The industry faces increased regulation not only by HMRC and the introduction of AWRS but also from the increased,
focus on alcohol and sugar from government and health bodies. Mangrove have all the relevant certi<U+FB01>cation and continue to ensure,
they exceed all the minimum requirements of the relevant authorities in all territories.,
Foreign Exchange Fluctuations: Broxit continues to cause fundamental currency weakness. Whilst this will aid the prevention of the,
"attractiveness of Grey Stock, the collapse in Sterling will put margins under pressure for a proportion of the business. We will aim to",
hold prices for as long as possible before adjusting in line with the rest of the market. We have taken steps to mitigate this by,
purchasing in Sterling and using forward buys to purchase currency at advantageous rates.,
Contract expiration: As Mangrove is not a producer we have contractual relations with brands and could lose the right to represent,
"these brands if contract negotiations are unsuccessful. Whilst this situation is currently secure, the Directors are looking at other ways",
"to secure the distribution rights, including brand creation and taking ownership stakes in brands.",
Financial key performance indicators,
The Directors consider the Key Indicators to be Turnover. Gross margin and Operating profit which reflect the overall financial health of,
the business.,

M G Hoskin,
Director,
Company registration number: 08867870,
Mansion Developments South West Limited,
Notes to the Abridged Financial Statements,
Year ended 31 January 2018,
1. General information,
"The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The address of the",
"registered office is Siblyback Farm, Common Moor, Liskeard, Cornwall, PL14 688.",
2. Statement of compliance,
"These abridged financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 1A of FRS 102, ‘The Financial",
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland'.,
3. Accounting policies,
Basis of preparation,
"The abridged <U+FB01>nancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the revaluation",
of certain financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at fair value through profit or loss.,
"The abridged financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.",
Revenue recognition,
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services,
"rendered, net of discounts and Value Added Tax. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the",
signi<U+FB01>cant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer (usually on despatch of the goods); the,
amount of revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that the associated economic benefits will flow to the,
entity; and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transactions can be measured reliably.,
Income tax,
The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised in the reporting,
"period. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other",
"comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or",
"directly in equity, respectively. Current tax is recognised on taxable profit for the current and past periods. Current",
tax is measured at the amounts of tax expected to pay or recover using the tax rates and laws that have been,
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.,
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved tax losses and other,
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal,
of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that,
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the,
timing difference.,
Tangible assets,
"Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation",
and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded at the fair value at the date,
of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. An,
"increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other comprehensive",
"income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset",
previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of revaluation. is,
recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any previously recognised revaluation increase,
accumulated in equity in respect of that asset. Where a revaluation decrease exceeds the accumulated revaluation,
"gains accumulated in equity in respect of that asset, the excess shall be recognised in profit or loss.",
Depreciation,
"Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value, over the useful",
economic life of that asset as follows:,
Impairment of fixed assets,
"A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable amount being",
"estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is",
impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. For the,
"purposes of impairment testing, when it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset,",
an estimate is made of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The,
cash-generating unit is the smallest identi<U+FB01>able group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows,
that largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. For impairment testing of,
"goodwill, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the",
"cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether",
other assets or liabilities of the company are assigned to those units.,
Stocks,
Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost includes,
"all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the stock to its present location and",
condition.,
Financial instruments,
A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised only when the company becomes a party to the contractual,
"provisions of the instrument. Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at the transaction price, unless the",
"arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where it is recognised at the present value of the future payments",
discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument. Debt instruments are subsequently measured,
at amortised cost. Where investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary shares or,
"preference shares are publicly traded or their fair value can othenNise be measured reliably, the investment is",
subsequently measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. All other such,
"investments are subsequently measured at cost less impairment. Other financial instruments, including derivatives,",
are initially recognised at fair value. unless payment for an asset is deferred beyond normal business terms or,
"financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate, in which case the asset is measured at the present value of",
the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument. Other <U+FB01>nancial instruments,
"are subsequently measured at fair value, with any Changes recognised in profit or loss, with the exception of",
hedging instruments in a designated hedging relationship.,
Financial assets that are measured at cost or amortised cost are reviewed for objective evidence of impairment at,
"the end of each reporting date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in",
"profit or loss immediately. For all equity instruments regardless of significance, and other financial assets that are",
"individually significant, these are assessed individually for impairment. Other financial assets are either assessed",
individually or grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics. Any reversals of impairment are recognised,
"in profit or loss immediately, to the extent that the reversal does not result in a carrying amount of the financial",
asset that exceeds what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not previously been recognised.,
4. Employee numbers,
The average number of persons employed by the company during the year amounted to 2 (2017: 2 ).,
5. Profit before taxation,

Stocks,
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined using the,
"<U+FB01>rst-in, <U+FB01>rst-out (FIFO) method.",
"The cost of <U+FB01>nished goods and work in progress comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those",
"overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. At each reporting date, stocks",
"are assessed for impairment. If stocks are impaired, the canying amount is reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and",
sell; the impairment loss is recognised immediately in pro<U+FB01>t or loss.,
Trade creditors,
Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from,
"suppliers. Accounts payable are classi<U+FB01>ed as current liabilities if the company does not have an unconditional right, at the end of",
"the reporting period, to defer settlement ()10 the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an",
"unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current",
liabilities.,
Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective,
interest method.,
Borrowings,
"Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Interest-bearing borrowings are",
"subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the ditt‘erence between the proceeds, net ot‘transaction costs, and the amount due on",
redemption being recognised as a charge to the Pro<U+FB01>t and Loss Account over the period of the relevant borrowing.,
Interest expense is recognised 0n the basis of the effective interest method and is included in interest payable and similar charges.,
Bon‘owings are classi<U+FB01>ed as current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional light to defer settlement of the liability for,
at least twelve months after the reportin g date.,
Leases,
Leases are classi<U+FB01>ed as <U+FB01>nance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership,
to the lessee.,
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of their fair value at inception of the lease and the present value of the,
minimum lease payments. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter 0f the useful life of the asset and,
the lease term. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a <U+FB01>nance lease obligation.,
Lease payments are apportioned between <U+FB01>nance costs in the Pro<U+FB01>t and Loss Account and reduction of the lease Obligation so as,
to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.,
Share capital,
Ordinary shares are classi<U+FB01>ed as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received,
"or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and the time value of money is",

Year ended 30 November 2017,
1. General information,
"The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in UK. The address of the registered office is 17",
"Mirror Path: London, SE9 4NY.",
2. Statement of compliance,
"These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the provisions of FRS 102, Section 1A, ‘The",
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland‘.,
3. Accounting policies,
Basis of preparation,
"The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modi<U+FB01>ed by the revaluation of certain",
financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at fair value through profit or loss.,
"The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity.",
Turnover,
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services,
"rendered, net of discounts and Value Added Tax.",
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the signi<U+FB01>cant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred,
"to the buyer, usually on despatch of the goods; the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that",
the associated economic benefits will flow to the entity and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the,
transactions can be measured reliably.,
Taxation,
The taxation expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax recognised in the reporting,
"period. Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that it relates to items",
"recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in capital and reserves. In this case, tax is recognised in",
"other comprehensive income or directly in capital and reserves, respectively. Current tax is recognised on taxable",
profit for the current and past periods. Current tax is measured at the amounts of tax expected to pay or recover,
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.,
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences at the reporting date. Unrelieved tax losses and other,
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal,
of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that,
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date that are expected to apply to the reversal of the,
timing difference.,
Financial instruments,
A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised only when the company becomes a party to the contractual,
"provisions of the instrument. Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at the transaction price, unless the",
"arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where it is recognised at the present value of the future payments",
discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument. Debt instruments are subsequently measured,
at amortised cost. Where investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary shares or,
"preference shares are publicly traded or their fair value can otherwise be measured reliably, the investment is",
subsequently measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. All other such,
"investments are subsequently measured at cost less impairment. Other financial instruments, including derivatives,",
are initially recognised at fair value. unless payment for an asset is deferred beyond normal business terms or,
"financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate, in which case the asset is measured at the present value of",
the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument. Other <U+FB01>nancial instruments,
"are subsequently measured at fair value, with any changes recognised in profit or loss, with the exception of",
hedging instruments in a designated hedging relationship.,
Financial assets that are measured at cost or amortised cost are reviewed for objective evidence of impairment at,
"the end of each reporting date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in",
"profit or loss immediately. For all equity instruments regardless of significance, and other financial assets that are",
"individually significant, these are assessed individually for impairment. Other financial assets or either assessed",
individually or grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics. Any reversals of impairment are recognised,
"in profit or loss immediately, to the extent that the reversal does not result in a carrying amount of the financial",
asset that exceeds what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not previously been recognised.,

The average number of persons employed by the company during the year amounted to Nil (2016: Nil).,

Company No. 10495174,
Director's Report and Unaudited Accounts,
30-Nov-17,
Taxation,
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.,
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as,
reported in the profit and loss account because of items of income or expense that are taxable or,
deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for,
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substa ntively enacted by the end of the,
reporting period.,
Deferred tax is recognised on timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in,
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.,
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets,
are generally recognised for all deductible timing differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable,
profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying,
amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent,
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset,
to be recovered.,
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in,
"which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted",
or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.,
"Current or deferred tax for the year is recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that",
"are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and",
deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.,
Freehold investment property,
Investment properties are revalued annually and any surplus or deficit is dealt with through the profit and,
loss account.,
No depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties.,
Investments,
Unlisted investments are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to,
"initial recognition, any changes in fair value are recognised in profit and loss.",
Stocks,
"Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Costs,",
"which comprise direct production costs, are based on the method most appropriate to the type of",
"inventory class, but usually on a first-in-first-out basis. Overheads are charged to profit or loss as incurred.",
Net realisable value is based on the estimated selling price less any estimated completion or selling costs.,
"When stocks are sold, the carrying amount of those stocks is recognised as an expense in the period in",
which the related revenue is recognised. The amount of any write-down of stocks to net realisable value,
and all losses of stocks are recognised as an expense in the period in which the write-down or loss occurs.,
The amount of any reversal of any write-down of stocks is recognised as a reduction in the amount of,
inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs.,
Trade and other debtors,
Trade and other debtors are initially recognised at fair value and thereafter stated at amortised cost using,
"the effective interest method, less impairment losses for bad and doubtful debts.",
Trade and other creditors,
"Short term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans)",
"are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised",
cost using the effective interest method.,
Foreign currencies,
"Transactions in currencies, other than the functional currency of the Company, are recorded at the rate of",
exchange on the date the transaction occurred. Monetary items denominated in other currencies are,
translated at the rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. all differences are taken to the profit,
and loss account. Non-monetary items that are measured at historic cost in a foreign currency are not,
retranslated.,
Leased assets,
Where the company enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of,
"ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.",
Leases which do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Company are,
classified as operating leases.,
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Company at their fair value at the,
"inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding",
liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet date as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are,
apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant,
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognised immediately in,
"profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in",
accordance with the Company‘s policy on borrowing costs (see the accounting policy above).,
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated in the same way as owned assets.,
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.,
"In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are",
recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense,
on a straight-line basis.,
Pensions,
The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a,
pension plan under which the company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the,
contributions have been paid the company has no further payments obligations. The contributions are,
recognised as expenses when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in accruals in the balance sheet.,
The assets of the plan are held separately from the company in independently administered funds.,
Provisions,
Provisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the Company a legal or constructive,
"obligation that probably requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate can",
be made of the amount of the obligation.,
Provisions are charged as an expense to the profit and loss account in the year that the Company becomes,
"aware of the obligation, and are measured at the best estimate at balance sheet date of the expenditure",
"required to settle the obligation, taking into account relevant risks and uncertainties.",
"When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the balance sheet.",

Statement of directors' responsibilities,
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable,
law and regulations.,
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors,
have elected to prepare the <U+FB01>nancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting,
Practice {United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law}. Under company law the directors must not approve,
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company,
"and of the pro<U+FB01>t or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required",
to:,
‘ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;,
‘ make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;,
° prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the,
company will continue in business.,
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are suf<U+FB01>cient to show and explain the,
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and,
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for,
safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud,
and other irregularities.,
Statement of disclosure to auditor,
"So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit",

necessary steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of all relevant audit,
information and to establish that the company's auditor is aware of that information.,
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions applicable to companies entitled to the small companies,
exemption.,

HERITAGE PROJECTS (EDINBURGH) LIMITED,
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT,
TO THE MEMBERS OF HERITAGE PROJECTS (EDINBURGH) LIMITED,
Opinion,
We have audited the financial statements of Heritage Projects (Edinburgh) Limited (the 'company') for the year ended 31,
"January 2018 which comprise the statement of income and retained earnings, the balance sheet and notes to the",
"financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has",
"been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 The",
Financiat Reporting Standard appticabte in the UK and Repubtt'c of trefand (United Kingdom Generally Accepted,
Accounting Practice).,
In our opinion the <U+FB01>nancial statements:,
' give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 January 2018 and of its profit for the year,
then ended;,
° have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and,
° have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.,
Basis for opinion,
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (U K)) and applicable law. Our,
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibitities for the audit of the financial,
statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that,
"are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled",
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have,
obtained is suf<U+FB01>cient and apprOpriate to provide a basis for our Opinion.,
Conclusions relating to going concern,
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you,
where:,
' the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not,
appropriate; or,
° the directors have not disclosed in the <U+FB01>nancial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast,
significant doubt about the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a,
period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.,
Other information,
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the,
"annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial",
"statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do",
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.,
"In connection with our audit of the financial statements. our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,",
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained,
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent,
"material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial",
"statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude",
"that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.",
We have nothing to report in this regard.,
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006,
In our opinion. based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:,
° the information given in the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is,
consistent with the <U+FB01>nancial statements; and,
° the directors’ report has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.,
