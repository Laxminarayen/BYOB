"606","The directors present their strategic report for the year ended 31 January 2018."
"607","The company's principal activities are the operation of Derbyshire’s oldest tourist attraction and the licencing, operation"
"608","and maintenance of cable suspended tranSport systems."
"609","REVIEW OF BUSINESS"
"610","The cable car transports visitors on a spectacularjourney high above the Derwent River to the 60 acres of landscaped"
"611","grounds at the summit. There, the company operates two famous show caverns, exhibitions, two children's playgrounds,"
"612","two retail facilities and cafe’ and restaurant dining facilities. Visitors also enjoy exploring the woodland walks and the"
"613","stunning Views ot‘beautiful Derbyshire countryside."
"614","In the past the company has also bene<U+FB01>tted from offering consultancy services in relation to new cable car related"
"615","installations. This revenue stream has only made a small contribution this <U+FB01>nancial year."
"616","In 20l 7 the company was awarded the Visit England Gold accolade, the only attraction in the East M idlands to do so"
"617","that year, and the third time in four years the company has won the award. The award is part of the Visit England Quality"
"618","Assured Visitor Attraction scheme, whereby the company is assessed on staff and facilities. The Gold accolade is only"
"619","awarded to attractions which score highly in all areas."
"620","Published infonnation in relation to competitor performance is limited, and any information is based on a relatively"
"621","small number of visitor attractions. The 2017 Visit England survey noted that Visitor numbers at paid-for attractions"
"622","ranged between a 2% decrease to an 8% increase, depending on attraction type and location."
"623","The Directors are pleased that in spite of the challenging market and weather in 2017, the company has performed within"
"624","these parameters. Income from cable car operations rose and average receipts per customer showed a modest increase in"
"625","both retail and catering during 2017."
"626","Resultant turnover has increased in each of the company’s core business areas, with company turnover increasing by"
"627","3.3% (2017: 8.9%). Year on year gross pro<U+FB01>t has been maintained but signi<U+FB01>cant repair costs have resulted in a net"
"628","pro<U+FB01>t reduction to £298,|75 (20l 7: £352,323)."
"629","In July 2018, the licence and operating and maintenance contracts with Cable TranSport Limited were terminated. This"
"630","will result in a reduction in annual turnover of around £180,000, however, despite this the company Will continue to"
"631","operate on a sound <U+FB01>nancial footing which the directors believe can be maintained and used as a platform to further the"
"632","company's business objectives."

"638","PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES"
"639","Economic"
"640","The company operates in the leisure market with turnover and pro<U+FB01>tability at risk of declining through the amount of"
"641","disposable income available to customers and their willingness to spend it with the company in what is a competitive"
"642","market both locally and nationally."
"643","Nevertheless, the company is well placed within that market due to it's unique product offering. The variety of historic,"
"644","scenic, educational, physical, retail and dining opportunities means that the company is not dependant on any one age,"
"645","demographic or social group."
"646","Weather"
"647","As an outdoors based leisure attraction, the company's ability to attract customers is signi<U+FB01>cantly affected by wet"

"1799","Fair review of the business"
"1800","The company is a well established groundworks and frame contractor trading for over 24 years. The company's head"
"1801","office in Northolt enables it to service its customer base in London as well as the South of England. The company also"
"1802","operates a construction service in Holland."
"1803","During the year the company has experienced significant expansion with turnover increasing by just over 14%. Please"
"1804","refer to key performance indicators for more details. The sustained growth was achieved despite challenging market"
"1805","conditions and increased competition. Improved efficiencies in project delivery and commercial management have both"
"1806","contributed to the achievements of the company coupled with the outstanding performance of its loyal and committed"
"1807","workforce."
"1808","The company continues to successfully tender for key contracts and continues to receive repeat orders from satis<U+FB01>ed"
"1809","customers and thereby continues to maintain its established customer base."
"1810","Principal risks and uncertainties"
"1811","Commercial Risk"
"1812","The company manages this risk by providing added value services to its clients, having fast response times not only in"
"1813","supplying products and services but also in handling all client queries and by maintaining strong relationships with clients."
"1814","The company’s commercial risk is reduced due to the market share of their clients as many of the company's clients are"
"1815","long standing market leaders in their field. The company has spread its commercial risk by not only actively seeking to"
"1816","widen its client base but also through continued expansion of its activities in the South of England and Europe."
"1817","Taxation risk"
"1818","The company is exposed to financial risks from increases in tax rates and changes to the basis of taxation including"
"1819","corporation tax and VAT. Principal controls to mitigate this risk include regular monitoring of legislative proposals and the"
"1820","engagement of experienced executives and the use of experienced sector-speoific professional advisers to mitigate the"
"1821","impact of changes."
"1822","Management risk"
"1823","The company is reliant on its small high calibre team of Operational managers, surveyors and board of directors. The"
"1824","company recruits and develops high calibre employees, many of whom have been with the company for a number of"
"1825","years. The board have tried to ensure that the knowledge base of the operational management team is shared as much"
"1826","as possible throughout the company."
"1827","Financing risk"
"1828","See Financial instruments."
"1829","Economic risk"
"1830","The directors have identified and evaluated risks and uncertainties and have controls in place to mitigate these."
"1831","Responsibility for management of each key risk is identified and delegated. The company is exposed to the risks of the"
"1832","economic downturn that could lower the company’s revenues and operating results in the future. However, actions"
"1833","continue to be taken to maximise the company's performance in all aspects of the business."
"1834","Development and performance"
"1835","The balance sheet on page 10 of the financial statements shows that the company's financial position at the year end is."
"1836","in both net assets and liquidity terms, an improvement over the previous year."

"1854","Market Share"
"1855","The company is a large privately owned construction service provider company based in the South East of England. The"
"1856","company enjoys greater than national average market share. Although dif<U+FB01>cult to quantify within a given criteria it is"
"1857","estimated to have a significant market share. Turnover has increased by just over 14% from £121.1m in 2017 to £138.1m"
"1858","in 2018."
"1859","Gross Profit Margin"
"1860","The company's gross profit margin has improved from 4.8% in 2017 to 6.9% in 2018, and reflects the increased"

"1863","Operating profit and EBITDA percentage of sales."
"1864","The directors view operating profit as a percentage of sales as a key performance indicator for the business and this is"
"1865","reviewed regularly. The ratio has increased from just over 3% in 2017 to just under 5.4% in 2018, after allowing for"
"1866","internal management charges. The EBITDA is often regarded as a more comparable measure of the performance of the"
"1867","business which shows that EBITDA percentage of sales has also increased from 3.1% to just under 5.4% over the course"
"1868","of the year. It is the intention of the company to focus on strengthening its financial performance in the industry by"
"1869","concentrating on customer retention, while at the same time monitoring both direct and indirect costs."
"1870","Accident Frequency rate"
"1871","The company is committed to a Target Zero safety culture in relation to RIDDOR‘s. The company is committed to keeping"
"1872","its RIDDOR accident frequency rate as close to zero as practicable. The company recognises that any accident or"
"1873","incident is one too many and it continually strives to eliminate the possibility of any dangerous occurrence by providing a"

"2516","financial dif<U+FB01>culties. Sales trends in its major markets are constantly reviewed to enable early"

"2518","Competitor pressure - the market in which the Company operates is considered to be relatively"

"2520","Company manages this risk by providing quality services and maintaining strong relationships with"
"2521","its key customers."
"2522","Loss of key personnel — this would present signi<U+FB01>cant operational difficulties for the Company."
"2523","- Management seek to ensure that key personnel are appropriately remunerated to ensure that good"

"3136","The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain properties and"
"3137","financial instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below."
"3138","Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets. The following"
"3139","accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the"
"3140","company’s financial statements."

"3146","1.2. Turnover"
"3147","Turnover comprises amounts invoiced for goods and services exclusive of value added tax."
"3148","Revenue Recognition"
"3149","The company’s revenues are derived from licence fees and charges for services. The company recognises licence revenue"
"3150","in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 605-10 “Revenue Recognition” and FASB ASC"
"3151","985-605 “Software Revenue Recognition” except where these criteria conflict with the requirements of FRS 102. For"
"3152","licence arrangements that do not require significant production, modification or customisation of the software, the"
"3153","company recognises licence revenue when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer exists; (2)"
"3154","delivery to the customer has occurred; (3) the fee to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection"
"3155","is probable."
"3156","If the licence fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable, revenue is recognised as payment becomes due,"
"3157","assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The company assesses whether fees are fixed or"
"3158","determinable at the time of sale and recognises revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. The"
"3159","standard payment terms are net 30; however, terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed."
"3160","Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on the company's"
"3161","successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. If"
"3162","collection of the fees from the customer is not considered probable, revenue is recognised when the fee is collected."
"3163","Revenue arrangements with resellers are recognised, net of fees, when persuasive evidence is received that the reseller"
"3164","has sold the products to an end user customer and all other revenue criteria are met."
"3165","The company generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to"
"3166","each element based on the relative fair values of the elements. Revenue recognised from multipIe-element arrangements"
"3167","is allocated to various elements of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements specific to the"
"3168","company. The company's determination of fair value of each element in multi-element arrangements is based on"
"3169","vendor—specific objective evidence (“VSOE”)."
"3170","The company limits its assessment of VSOE for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold"
"3171","separately or the price established by management, having the relevant authority to do so, for an element not yet sold"
"3172","separately."
"3173","If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered"
"3174","elements, then revenue is recognised using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the"
"3175","undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognised as revenue."
"3176","Revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognised rateably over the maintenance term, typically one year."
"3177","Revenue allocated to implementation, training and other service elements is recognised as the services are performed."
"3178","The company obtains VSOE for maintenance from substantive renewal rates based on consistent percentages of the"
"3179","licence fee."
"3180","Service revenues are derived mainly from implementation and training services. Services are provided primarily on a time"
"3181","and materials basis for which revenue is recognised in the period that the services are provided."
"3182","Arrangements that include services are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of"
"3183","other elements of the arrangement. When services are not considered essential, the revenues allocable t0 the software"
"3184","services are recognised as the services are performed."
"3185","The company also offers hosting arrangements, known as Software as a Service (SaaS). With hosting arrangements, the"
"3186","company installs and runs software applications through its own or third-party’s servers giving customers access to the"
"3187","application via the internet or a dedicated line. Hosting arrangements are within the scope of FASB ASC 985-605 if the"
"3188","customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without"
"3189","significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either run the software on its own hardware or contract with"
"3190","another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software without significant penalty. Assuming all other revenue"
"3191","recognition criteria have been met, and VSOE has been established for the hosting element, revenue is recognised on the"
"3192","portion of the fee attributable to the licence on delivery, while the portion of the fee related to the hosting element would"
"3193","be recognised rateably as the service is provided."
"3194","In SaaS term-based arrangements, where the customer does not have the contractual right to take possession of"
"3195","software, SaaS fees are recognised on a monthly basis over the term of the contract commencing when the customer has"
"3196","access to the software. For SaaS arrangements, the Company evaluates whether each of the elements in these"
"3197","arrangements represents a separate unit of accounting, using all applicable facts and circumstances, including whether (i)"
"3198",""
"3199","the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis (ii) If a general right of return exists relative to the"
"3200","delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in the control"

"3241","determined. The resulting exchange differences are dealt with in the Income Statement."
"3242","1.7. Taxation"
"3243","Current tax represents the amount expected to be paid or recovered in respect of taxable profits for the year and is"
"3244","calculated using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the Statement of Financial"
"3245","Position date."
"3246","Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet"

"3448","appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion."
"3449","Conclusions Relating to Going Concern"
"3450","We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you"
"3451","where:"
"3452","' the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not"

"3455","doubt about the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least"
"3456","twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue."
"3457","Opinion on Other Matter Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006"
"3458","In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:"

"3469","In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we"
"3470","have not identified material misstatements in the directors‘ report."
"3471","We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in"
"3472","our opinion:"
"3473","° adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches"
"3474","not visited by us;"
"3475","' the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records or returns;"
"3476","' certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made;"

"3479","take advantage of the small companies' exemptions in preparing the directors' report and from the requirement to"
"3480","prepare a strategic report."
"3481","Responsibilities of Directors"
"3482","As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement set out on page 2, the directors are responsible for the"
"3483","preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as"
"3484","the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are Free from material misstatement,"
"3485","whether due to fraud or error."
"3486","In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going"
"3487","concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the"
"3488","directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so."
"3489","Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements"
"3490","Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material"
"3491","misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor‘s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is"
"3492","a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a"
"3493","material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or"
"3494","in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these"
"3495","financial statements."
"3496","A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's"

"4616","NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"
"4617","FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2018"
"4618","1. STATUTORY INFORMATION"
"4619","Holm Oak Estates Limited is a private company, limited by shares , registered in England and Wales."
"4620","The company's registered number and registered of<U+FB01>ce address can be found on the General"
"4621","Information page."
"4622","The presentation currency of the financial statements is the Pound Sterling (£)."
"4623","2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES"
"4624","Basis of preparing the financial statements"
"4625","These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 ""The"
"4626","Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland"" and the Companies Act 2006. The"
"4627","financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of"
"4628","certain assets."
"4629","Significant judgements and estimates"
"4630","The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also"
"4631","requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the company accounting"
"4632","policies. The areas involving a higher degree ofjudgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions"
"4633","and estimates are signi<U+FB01>cant to the financial statements are disclosed within the individual accounting"
"4634","policies below."
"4635","Turnover"
"4636","Turnover is the total amount receivable by the company for goods supplied and services provided,"
"4637","excluding VAT and trade discounts."
"4638","Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and benefits of ownership of"
"4639","the product have been transferred to the buyer."
"4640","Revenue from services provided is recognised when the company has performed its obligations and in"
"4641","exchange obtained the right to consideration."
"4642","In respect of incomplete contracts, and t0 the extent that a right to consideration arises, the amount of"
"4643","revenue recognised reflects the accrual of the right to this consideration by reference to the value of"
"4644","work performed to date. Revenue not billed to clients is included in debtors and payments received on"
"4645","account in excess of the relevant amount of revenue are included in creditors."
"4646","Tangible fixed assets"
"4647","Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life."
"4648","Freehold property — 2% on cost"
"4649","Plant and machinery - 25% on cost"
"4650","Motor vehicles - 33% on cost and 25% on cost"
"4651","Office equipment - 20% on cost"
"4652","Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses."
"4653","Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted"
"4654","for as separate items of property, plant and equipment."
"4655","Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date. The"
"4656","selection of these residual values and estimated lives requires the exercise ofjudgement. The"
"4657","directors are required to assess whether there is an indication of impairment to the carrying value of"
"4658","assets. In making that assessment, judgements are made in estimating value in use. The directors"
"4659","consider that the individual carrying values of assets are supportable by their value in use."

"4669","Investment property"
"4670","Investment property is shown at most recent valuation. Any aggregate surplus or deficit arising from"
"4671","changes in fair value is recognised in profit or loss."
"4672","Stocks"
"4673","Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for"
"4674","obsolete and slow moving items."
"4675","Work in progress"
"4676","Work in progress is valued on the basis of direct cost. Provision is made for any foreseeable losses,"
"4677","where appropriate. N0 element of profit is included in the valuation of work in progress."
"4678","Financial instruments"
"4679","Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short term"
"4680","deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less."
"4681","Debtors and creditors with no stated interest rate and receivable or payable within one year are"
"4682","recorded at transaction price. Any losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of"
"4683","comprehensive income under administrative expenses."
"4684","Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual"
"4685","arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in"
"4686","the assets of the entity after deducting all of its <U+FB01>nancial liabilities."
"4687","Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a"
"4688","similar debt instrument, those financial instruments are classed as financial liabilities. Financial"
"4689","liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet. Finance costs and gains or losses relating to"
"4690","financial liabilities are included in the profit and loss account. Finance costs are calculated so as to"
"4691","produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding liability."
"4692","Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a"
"4693","financial liability then this is classed as an equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to"
"4694","equity instruments are debited direct to equity."
"4695","Taxation"
"4696","Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated"
"4697","Statement of Comprehensive Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other"
"4698","comprehensive income or directly in equity."
"4699","Current or deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not discounted."
"4700","Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been"
"4701","enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date."
"4702","Deferred tax"
"4703","Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at"
"4704","the balance sheet date."
"4705","Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods"
"4706","different from those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured"
"4707","using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are"
"4708","expected to apply to the reversal of the timing difference."
"4709","Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable"
"4710","that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits."

"5191","REVIEW OF BUSINESS"
"5192","The results for the year and financial position of the group are as shown in the annexed financial statements."
"5193","The group continued to experience growth during the last financial year and produced a very satisfactory"
"5194","financial performance. Total turnover on continuing operations increased by £786,427 to £13,981,113"
"5195","resulting in net profit before tax of £944,156 and representing a net margin of 6.75% on sales. Sales have"
"5196","increased by 6% while margins have been maintained."
"5197","During the year, new vehicles and plant to the value of £548k were acquired, a strategy which resulted in an"
"5198","increased depreciation charge against profits. The group was able to finance these assets from its own"
"5199","resources and at the same time maintain working capital at satisfactory levels."
"5200","During the year, the group also purchased one new property along with the deposit for another property that"
"5201","completed after the year end."
"5202","The year was one of consolidation during which there was further investment in plant and equipment and"
"5203","property."
"5204","The group relies heavily on tarmac suppliers both in terms of quality of product and punctual delivery."
"5205","During the year the group attained quality standard ISO 9001:2015 and is currently applying for 14001"
"5206","Environment accreditation. These quality standards will rank alongside the group's other industry specific"
"5207","accreditations all of which can be viewed on the website."
"5208","The group‘s credit control and cash flow management strategies continue to be rigorously applied and in the"
"5209","year under review this resulted in there being no bad debts and increased cash balances."
"5210","Current trading results are ahead of those budgeted."
"5211","Cash flow generated from Operations remains strong."

"5216","Pricing of raw materials is critical and is significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and"
"5217","the maintenance of a good relationship with primary suppliers."
"5218","The uncertainties arising from Brexit negotiations are also a risk to the business, as it it dependant upon the"
"5219","ready supply of a skilled workforce and any possible changes to trading and tariffs resulting from the outcome"
"5220","of these negotiations."

"5295","Opinion"
"5296","We have audited the financial statements of Holm Oak Estates Limited (the 'parent company') and its"
"5297","subsidiaries (the 'group') for the year ended 31 March 2018 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of"

"5305","In our opinion the <U+FB01>nancial statements:"

"5309","and"
"5310","- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006."
"5311","Basis for opinion"
"5312","We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and"
"5313","applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors'"

"5317","accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and"
"5318","appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion."
"5319","Conclusions relating to going concern"
"5320","We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to"
"5321","report to you where:"
"5322","the directors‘ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is"
"5323","' not appropriate; or"
"5324","the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may"
"5325","- cast significant doubt about the group's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting"
"5326","for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue."
"5327","Other information"
"5328","The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information in the"
"5329","Group Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors, but does not include the financial statements and our"
"5330","Report of the Auditors thereon."
"5331","Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form"
"5332","of assurance conclusion thereon."
"5333","In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and,"

"5336","have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required"
"5337","to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard."
"5338","Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006"

"5351","Report or the Report of the Directors."

"5355","adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit"

"5359","- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit."
"5360","Responsibilities of directors"
"5361","As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities set out on page four, the directors are"
"5362","responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair"
"5363","view, and for such internal control as the directors determine necessary to enable the preparation of financial"
"5364","statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error."
"5365","In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group‘s and the parent"
"5366","company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern"
"5367","and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the"
"5368","parent company or to cease Operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so."
"5369","Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements"
"5370","Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free"
"5371","from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a Report of the Auditors that includes"
"5372","our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit"
"5373","conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists."
"5374","Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,"
"5375","they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these"
"5376","financial statements."

"5760","applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime. The disclosure requirements of section 1A of FRS"

"5780","whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the"
"5781","recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where"

"7200","Tangible assets"
"7201","tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and are subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated"
"7202","depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded at the fair value"
"7203","at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment"
"7204","losses. An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other"
"7205","comprehensive income and accumulated in capital and reserves, except to the extent it reverses a revaluation"
"7206","decrease of the same asset previously recognised in profit or loss. A decrease in the carrying amount of an asset"
"7207","as a result of revaluation is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent of any previously recognised"
"7208","revaluation increase accumulated in capital and reserves in respect of that asset. Where a revaluation decrease"
"7209","exceeds the accumulated revaluation gains accumulated in capital and reserves in respect of that asset, the"
"7210","excess shall be recognised in profit or loss."
"7211","Depreciation"
"7212","Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value, over the useful"
"7213","economic life of that asset as follows:"
"7214","Fittings <U+FB01>xtures and equipment - 25 0/0 reducing balance"
"7215","If there is an indication that there has been a significant change in depreciation rate, useful life or residual value of"
"7216","tangible assets, the depreciation is revised prospectively to reflect the new estimates."
"7217","Impairment"
"7218","A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable amount being"
"7219","estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is"
"7220","impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date. When it is"
"7221","not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, an estimate is made of the recoverable"
"7222","amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The cash—generating unit is the smallest identifiable"

"9028","The company is a private company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales. The address of the"
"9029","registered office is St Georges House, 6th Floor, 15 Hanover Square, London, W18 1H8, United Kingdom."
"9030","2. Statement of compliance"
"9031","These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 1A of FRS 102, ’The Financial"
"9032","Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland'."
"9033","3. Accounting policies"
"9034","Basis of preparation"
"9035","The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modi<U+FB01>ed by the revaluation of certain"
"9036","financial assets and liabilities and investment prOperties measured at fair value through profit or loss. The financial"
"9037","statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the entity."
"9038","Revenue recognition"
"9039","Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services"
"9040","rendered, net of discounts and Value Added Tax. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the"
"9041","signi<U+FB01>cant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer (usually on despatch of the goods); the"
"9042","amount of revenue can be measured reliably; it is probable that the associated economic benefits will flow to the"
"9043","entity; and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transactions can be measured reliably."
"9044","Foreign currencies"
"9045","Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in the functional currency, by applying the spot exchange rate"
"9046","as at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at"
"9047","the exchange rate ruling at the reporting date, with any gains or losses being taken to the profit and loss account."
"9048","Stocks"
"9049","Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost includes"
"9050","all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the stock to its present location and"
"9051","condition."
"9052","Government grants"
"9053","Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable. Grants are not recognised"
"9054","until there is reasonable assurance that the company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the"
"9055","grants will be received. Government grants are recognised using the accrual model and the performance model."
"9056","Under the accrual model, government grants relating to revenue are recognised on a systematic basis over the"
"9057","periods in which the company recognises the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. Grants"
"9058","that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate"
"9059","financial support to the entity with no future related costs are recognised in income in the period in which it"
"9060","becomes receivable. Grants relating to assets are recognised in income on a systematic basis over the expected"
"9061","useful life of the asset. Where part of a grant relating to an asset is deferred, it is recognised as deferred income"
"9062","and not deducted from the carrying amount of the asset. Under the performance model, where the grant does not"
"9063","impose specified future performance-related conditions on the recipient, it is recognised in income when the grant"
"9064","proceeds are received or receivable. Where the grant does impose speci<U+FB01>ed future performance-related conditions"
"9065","on the recipient, it is recognised in income only when the performance-related conditions have been met. Where"
"9066","grants received are prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria, they are recognised as a liability."
"9067",""
"9068","Financial instruments"
"9069","A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised only when the company becomes a party to the contractual"
"9070","provisions of the instrument. Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at the transaction price, unless the"
"9071","arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where it is recognised at the present value of the future payments"
"9072","discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument. Debt instruments are subsequently measured"
"9073","at amortised cost. Where investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary shares or"
"9074","preference shares are publicly traded or their fair value can otherwise be measured reliably, the investment is"
"9075","subsequently measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. All other such"
"9076","investments are subsequently measured at cost less impairment. Other financial instruments, including derivatives,"
"9077","are initially recognised at fair value. unless payment for an asset is deferred beyond normal business terms or"
"9078","financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate, in which case the asset is measured at the present value of"
"9079","the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument. Other <U+FB01>nancial instruments"
"9080","are subsequently measured at fair value, with any changes recognised in profit or loss, with the exception of"
"9081","hedging instruments in a designated hedging relationship."
"9082","Financial assets that are measured at cost or amortised cost are reviewed for objective evidence of impairment at"
"9083","the end of each reporting date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in"
"9084","profit or loss immediately. For all equity instruments regardless of significance, and other financial assets that are"
"9085","individually significant, these are assessed individually for impairment. Other financial assets are either assessed"
"9086","individually or grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics. Any reversals of impairment are recognised"
"9087","in profit or loss immediately, to the extent that the reversal does not result in a carrying amount of the financial"
"9088","asset that exceeds what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not previously been recognised."

"9572","1. General information"
"9573","Mangrove Global Limited is a private company, limited by shares, incorporated in England and Wales, United Kingdom, with a"
"9574","registration number 08674207. The address of the registered office is 53 Redbridge Lane, Ilford, Essex, |G4 5EY."
"9575","The nature of the company's operations and principal activities are the importation and distribution of various spirit brands from"
"9576","around the world."
"9577","2. Accounting policies"
"9578","2.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements"
"9579","The <U+FB01>nancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified within these"
"9580","accounting policies and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard"
"9581","applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 2006."
"9582","The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting"
"9583","estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgment in applying the Company's accounting policies (see note 3)."
"9584","The <U+FB01>nancial statements are presented in sterling which is the functional currency of the company and rounded to the"
"9585","nearest pound sterling."
"9586","The following principal accounting policies have been applied:"
"9587","2.2 Revenue"
"9588","Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the"
"9589","revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable,"
"9590","excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before"
"9591","revenue is recognised:"
"9592","Sale of goods"
"9593","Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied:"
"9594","- the Company has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer;"
"9595","- the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership"
"9596","nor effective control over the goods sold;"
"9597","' the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;"
"9598","' it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration due under the transaction; and"
"9599","' the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably."
"9600","2.3 Intangible assets"
"9601","Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition. under the cost model, intangible assets are measured"
"9602","at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses."
"9603","All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life cannot be made, the"
"9604","useful life shall not exceed ten years."

"9610","2. Accounting policies (continued)"
"9611","2.4 Tangible fixed assets"
"9612","Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any"
"9613","accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to"
"9614","the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management."
"9615","Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives, on"
"9616","the following basis..."
"9617","Motor vehicles - 25% reducing balance"
"9618","Fixtures and fittings - 20% straight line"
"9619","Computer equipment - 33% straight line"
"9620","The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prOSpectively if"
"9621","appropriate, or it there is an indication of a signi<U+FB01>cant change since the last reporting date."
"9622","Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised"
"9623","in the Statement of Comprehensive Income."
"9624","2.5 Valuation of investments"
"9625","Investments in unlisted Company shares, whose market value can be reliably determined, are remeasured to market"
"9626","value at each balance sheet date. Gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the Statement of"
"9627","Comprehensive Income for the period. Where market value cannot be reliably determined, such investments are stated at"
"9628","historic cost less impairment."
"9629","2.6 Stocks"
"9630","Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less costs to complete"
"9631","and sell. Cost is based on the cost of purchase on a first in, first out basis. Work in progress and finished goods"
"9632","include labour and attributable overheads."
"9633","At each balance sheet date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stock is impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to"

"9708","Defined contribution pension plan"
"9709","The Company operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under"
"9710","which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been paid the Company"
"9711","has no further payment obligations."
"9712","The contributions are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when they fall due. Amounts"

"9731","2.16 Current and deferred taxation"
"9732","The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive"
"9733","Income, except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other comprehensive income"
"9734","or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity"
"9735","respectively."
"9736","The current income tax Charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively"
"9737","enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company operates and generates income."
"9738","Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the"
"9739","Balance Sheet date, except that:"
"9740","- The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against"
"9741","the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; and"
"9742","' Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax allowances have"
"9743","been met."
"9744","Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of business"
"9745","combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of assets acquired and the"
"9746","future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair values of liabilities acquired and the amount"
"9747","that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively"
"9748","enacted by the balance sheet date."
"9749","3. Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty"
"9750","In applying the Company‘s accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in"
"9751","determining the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. The directors' judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on"
"9752","the best and most reliable evidence available at the time when the decisions are made, and are based on historical experience"
"9753","and other factors that are considered to be applicable. Due to the inherent subjectivity involved in making such judgements,"
"9754","estimates and assumptions, the actual results and outcomes may differ."
"9755","The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are"
"9756","recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision"
"9757","and future periods, if the revision affects both current and future periods."
"9758","The directors do not believe that there have been judgements (apart from those involving estimates) made in the process of"
"9759","applying the above accounting policies that have had a significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements."
"9760","There are no key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty, that have a significant"
"9761","risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year."

"10063","Introduction"
"10064","The Principal activity of the company was the importation and distribution of various spirit brands from around the world. Operating in"
"10065","the premium sector and across all channels Mangrove aims to have an appropriate product in every category. In addition to this core"
"10066","business Mangrove also has some limited operations abroad in Europe and the USA."
"10067","I believe we have made another year of strong progress at Mangrove. Having focused on the key priorities of building brand equity for"
"10068","our partners, recruiting a team to deliver unparalled knowledge and service levels and by ensuring we have an enviable portfolio, we"
"10069","are leading the way in the UK. Our balance sheet reflects the progress we have made and continue to make and these foundations"
"10070","Should continue to deliver in future years. Feedback from our customers, supplier partners and shareholders continues to shape our"
"10071","business ensuring we are delivering a highly relevant commercial product offering within the premium sector whilst ensuring the"
"10072","business continues to operate from a strong commercial base. We have stabilised our business with a view to currency exposure and"
"10073","now we are rebuilding profitability. But there is much more we want to do. Our intention is to become even more competitive for"
"10074","customers, a more rewarding employer for our employees and an even better partner for suppliers, while creating long-term value for"
"10075","our shareholders. At the centre of everything is our purpose: to help premium brands achieve their potential in the UK marketplace."
"10076","Business review"
"10077","We aim to present a balanced and in depth review of the development and performance if our business during the year and is written in"
"10078","the contexts of the risks and uncertainties. The company performed well during the year, with profit for the year being £311,349 (201?:"
"10079","£105,974) with net assets of £910,323 (2017: £1,034,634). Margins were improved despite some rigorous price competition. There are"
"10080","some opportunities that I believe we well placed to benefit from as the move towards premiumisation and a wish for our customers to"
"10081","rationalise their supplier base makes us a natural partner. Brands are seeking us out in ever increasing numbers and we will continue"
"10082","to evolve the portfolio as these opportunities arise. Changing consumer habits, continued currency volatility and financial weakness"
"10083","amongst a segment of our customer base offer Challenges but we have adopted a number of strategies to mitigate these as proven this"
"10084","year. Brexit offers a degree of uncertainty that will affect the industry as a whole but the Directors are very confident in their ability, the"
"10085","flexibility of the business and the desirability of the portfolio to be able to take advantage of any opportunities that arise."
"10086","We firmly believe that we have a number of reasons to be optimistic about the coming years as tight cost control and a portfolio in"
"10087","growth will deliver ever stronger results."

"10093","Principal risks and uncertainties"
"10094","Competition: There is a great deal of competition from other agents as well at product level. Consolidation within the industry has"
"10095","seen opportunity arise for a number of small players but a lack of options for the larger mature brands. Mangrove is well reapected and"
"10096","well placed to be able to take advantage of these opportunities should they occur. The competitive landscape will remain challenging."
"10097","Regulation: The industry faces increased regulation not only by HMRC and the introduction of AWRS but also from the increased"
"10098","focus on alcohol and sugar from government and health bodies. Mangrove have all the relevant certi<U+FB01>cation and continue to ensure"
"10099","they exceed all the minimum requirements of the relevant authorities in all territories."
"10100","Foreign Exchange Fluctuations: Broxit continues to cause fundamental currency weakness. Whilst this will aid the prevention of the"
"10101","attractiveness of Grey Stock, the collapse in Sterling will put margins under pressure for a proportion of the business. We will aim to"
"10102","hold prices for as long as possible before adjusting in line with the rest of the market. We have taken steps to mitigate this by"
"10103","purchasing in Sterling and using forward buys to purchase currency at advantageous rates."
"10104","Contract expiration: As Mangrove is not a producer we have contractual relations with brands and could lose the right to represent"
"10105","these brands if contract negotiations are unsuccessful. Whilst this situation is currently secure, the Directors are looking at other ways"
"10106","to secure the distribution rights, including brand creation and taking ownership stakes in brands."
"10107","Financial key performance indicators"
"10108","The Directors consider the Key Indicators to be Turnover. Gross margin and Operating profit which reflect the overall financial health of"
